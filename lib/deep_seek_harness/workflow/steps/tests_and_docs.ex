  Step ④: after a (sub)task's code changes, requires tests and
  documentation to be added or updated for them, then actually runs
  `mix test` to verify it rather than trusting the model's own claim.

  `run_for/3` is the reusable core: it's called once at the top level
  (against the workflow's own branch, via the `run/2` behaviour
  callback) and again internally, once per accepted subtask, by
  `Steps.TaskSplit` -- before that subtask's branch is merged back, so a
  broken test/doc pass is caught and attributed to the right subtask
  instead of surfacing only after everything has already been merged.
