defmodule Yoke.CLI.Interrupt do
  @moduledoc """
  Lets the user break out of an in-flight "AI is responding" turn by
  pressing Ctrl+Q, instead of only Ctrl+C -- which raises SIGINT and tears
  down the whole Erlang VM (losing the entire session, not just the one
  long/misbehaving turn).

  `run/2` executes `turn_fun` (a blocking call into
  `Yoke.Brain.Session`, e.g. `Session.send_user_message/2` or
  `Session.generate_code_review/3`) in its own Task while concurrently
  watching raw keystrokes for Ctrl+Q. On Ctrl+Q, `Session.cancel_current_turn/1`
  is called against `session_pid`, which aborts the session's own in-flight
  agent-loop Task and makes the still-pending `turn_fun` call return
  `{:error, "Turn cancelled by user (Ctrl+Q)."}` almost immediately -- the
  session process itself is never killed, so conversation history up to
  (but not including) the interrupted turn is preserved intact.

  Known limitation: while a permission-confirmation or `ask_question`
  modal is on-screen (i.e. `Yoke.CLI.Spinner` is paused -- see
  `Yoke.CLI.Spinner.with_paused/1`), the keystroke watcher below
  backs off entirely rather than competing with that modal for keystrokes.
  Ctrl+Q is only recognized while the spinner itself is actively showing
  ("AI is responding"), not while the AI is waiting on a modal answer --
  use the modal's own Ctrl+C ("deny"/"cancelled") in that case.
